# AI RolePlay - Handover

> Development of this product continues in its own repository: https://github.com/maverick-nair/AIRolePlay2.0 (standalone tooling, job based LLM routing in the backend). This copy inside the monorepo is kept as the reference import and is not updated further.

## What it is

An AI RolePlay product with two deliberately different propositions on one instrument:

- **Practice**: unlimited attempts, rewind to any of your turns (the persona rewinds with you), criteria available on request, in the moment hints, selectable persona difficulty, and a trend across attempts. Scores are for the learner.
- **Assessment**: one attempt per scenario, a fixed time limit, a standardised persona that follows a schedule of critical incidents, hidden criteria, no hints and no rewind. The lock lives in the attempt store.

Scenario shipped: **Renewal Negotiation with Margaret Hale** (VP Procurement, Northwind Freight). No emojis, no em or en dashes. Dark and light themes, WCAG 2.2 AA.

Every score is produced the same way in both modes: an LLM (or the offline heuristic) classifies each participant turn into a band (Strong, Adequate, Weak, Harmful) against authored behavioural indicators with written anchors, quoting the words that justify the band. Rules turn bands into points through a fixed consequence table. No model ever emits a number into a score. Every rating in the report traces to quoted turns, and every report states where the instrument sits on the claim ladder (rung 1 of 4 today: structured feedback, not for talent decisions).

## Run

The app lives at `apps/roleplay` inside the GenieKreator monorepo (pnpm workspace).

```
pnpm install              # at the repo root
pnpm dev                  # Vite dev server with the offline providers (PORT env var, default 8443)
pnpm server               # local API server on ROLEPLAY_API_PORT (default 8787)
pnpm dev:ai               # Vite with VITE_AI_PROVIDER=http, proxies /api to the server
pnpm build                # production build
pnpm typecheck            # tsc --noEmit (src, server, test)
pnpm test                 # vitest: scoring engine, classifier heuristics, report assembly
```

The root `pnpm lint`, `pnpm lint:copy`, `pnpm format:check` (Prettier) and `pnpm test` also cover this folder.

Providers: `VITE_AI_PROVIDER=mock` (default) runs everything in the browser with scripted persona lines, a transparent pattern based classifier and a template report writer. `VITE_AI_PROVIDER=http` sends persona, classification and report calls to the API server. The server uses Claude through the official SDK when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL_NPC` and `LLM_MODEL_JUDGE` are set, otherwise it answers with the same offline providers. `ROLEPLAY_DUAL_PASS=1` runs each classification twice and reports the agreement; on disagreement the more conservative band is kept. See `.env.example`.

Stack: React 19, TypeScript, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS v4, Zod 4, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, jsPDF (lazy loaded), Vitest, Node http for the server (run with tsx).

## Files

- `src/App.tsx` - shell: theme provider, page switch, session config, attempt list.
- `src/pages/` - `LandingPage` (briefing, skills with indicators, objectives, instrument status, mode chooser), `SessionPage` (turn loop, snapshots and rewind, hints, incident scheduling via the provider, report build on End Call), `SummaryPage` (Overview, Evidence by Skill, Communication, Transcript, Method tabs).
- `src/domain/` - pure, deterministic:
  - `scenario.ts` Zod schemas. A scenario is `stimulus` (persona, hidden interests, opening, critical incidents, mock lines) plus `instrument` (skills, indicators with anchors and coaching copy, objectives, claim rung, evidence summary, peer baseline). `validateScenario` checks cross references.
  - `scoring.ts` consequence tables (`BAND_POINTS`, `NOT_OBSERVED_POINTS`), indicator and skill scoring, overall score and coverage, objective completion, per turn XP, streak and badge rules, level thresholds, practice hints.
  - `report.ts` report assembly from engine output plus narrative, transcript tagging from evidence, report ids.
  - `descriptive.ts` transcript derived conversation metrics (talk share, questions, offers, filler). Descriptive only, never scored.
  - `instrumentStatus.ts` the four rung claim ladder and what each rung requires.
- `src/providers/` - `types.ts` (interfaces and Zod request and response schemas shared with the server), `mock.ts` (offline persona, heuristic classifier, template writer), `http.ts` (calls `/api/*`, validates responses, falls back to mock), `index.ts` (selection).
- `src/store/attempts.ts` - localStorage attempt store standing in for the sessions backend; enforces the one assessment attempt.
- `src/data/scenarios/renewalNegotiation.ts` - the authored scenario. `src/data/` also keeps `badges.ts`, `peers.ts`, `bands.ts` and the sample cohort numbers.
- `src/components/` - `TenPointScale`, `SkillScore`, `SkillRadar`, `ScoreRing`, `BandChip`, `ClaimLadderPanel`, `AttemptTrend`, `VoiceWave`, `BoxField`, `ConfettiBurst`, `BadgeMedal`, `FlameIcon`, `RollingNumber`, `EmailDialog`, `ThemeToggle`, `ToolButton`, `CountdownTimer`, `SectionLabel`, `LeaderboardIcon`.
- `src/lib/` - `score.ts` (`bandFor`, `scoreColor`, `scoreLabel`, `cefrColor`), `color.ts` (`readableOn`), `motion.ts`, `useCountUp.ts`, `buildReportPdf.ts` (renders the report object), `theme.ts`.
- `server/index.ts` - API routes `/api/npc`, `/api/classify`, `/api/report`, `/api/health`. Prompts are versioned files in `/prompts/roleplay/{npc,classify,report}/v1.md`; structured outputs are validated with Zod and retried once.
- `test/scoring.test.ts` - engine, classifier, hints, descriptive metrics, report assembly, claim ladder.

## Theme tokens (index.css)

- `:root` = dark, `:root.light` = light.
- `--ink` is RGB channels: use `rgb(var(--ink) / a)`. `--bg` is hex: use `color-mix(in srgb, var(--bg) X%, transparent)`, never `rgb(var(--bg)/a)`.
- Dark: bg `#0e0d0c`, brand `#ff8a4c`, accent `#c2410c`. Light: bg `#f4f2ef`, brand `#b8320f`.
- Secondary text must be `text-ink/70` or stronger (lower fails AA in light theme).

## Knolskape 10-point bands

Novice 1-2 `#b5472f`, Emerging 3-4 `#e07b2e`, Competent 5-6 `#efc23a`, Proficient 7-8 `#8dc063`, Role Model 9-10 `#2f7a34`. Use `bandFor(score)` and `readableOn(hex)`. Only the band containing the score is elevated. Behavioural bands (Strong, Adequate, Weak, Harmful) use `BAND_COLORS` in `BandChip`.

## Scoring rules (engine, do not change without re-validating)

- Band points: Strong 10, Adequate 7, Weak 4, Harmful 1. An indicator never observed counts 4, because every indicator in this scenario has an opportunity to appear.
- Repeated hits on one indicator average their points.
- Skill score = rounded mean of indicator points, clamped to 1 to 10. Overall = weighted mean of skill scores, rounded. Pass mark is per scenario (8 here).
- Objective complete = an Adequate or better band on one of its listed indicators. XP: 25 for on topic, 45 per newly met objective, a length bonus capped at 20, times 1.5 from the third strong reply in a row. Off topic turns earn nothing and reset the streak.
- Conversation metrics and language analysis are descriptive and never enter the score. Audio is scored by transcript only; no voice or facial emotion inference anywhere.

## What is still mocked (needed before production)

1. **Persona, classifier and report writer** run offline by default. With a key the API server uses Claude. The LLM path has not yet been exercised against a live key in this repository; validate the prompts and output schemas on real traffic first.
2. **Speech**: dictation types a fixed phrase, the camera is a stock image, there is no text to speech. Real STT and TTS belong behind adapters on the server, with consent before capture.
3. **Sessions, peers and leaderboard**: attempts persist in localStorage, peer baselines and the leaderboard are sample constants. The report shape in `src/domain/report.ts` is what the backend should store.
4. **Email** is a mailto handoff; real sending with the PDF attached needs a server.
5. **Validation**: the instrument is on claim rung 1. Rung 2 needs a calibration set rated by trained assessors with agreement per skill; rung 3 needs parallel forms and subgroup fairness analysis; rung 4 needs convergent and criterion evidence and a technical manual. Do not change the rung in the scenario file without that evidence.

## Code rules

Default exports for components; double quotes for strings with apostrophes; global CSS and fonts in `index.css`; respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Formatting is Prettier with the repo root config. Say "skills", never "competency". No em or en dashes anywhere (the root copy lint fails on them). Prompts live only in `/prompts`, never inline.
